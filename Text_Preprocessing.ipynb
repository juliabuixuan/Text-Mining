              "3  i at least have to give this restaurant two stars due to the decent food. but while on a dinner meeting and after spending $ on entrées and appetizers, i had to flag down the assistant cook, (the guy in bright red baggy pants watching tv), to see if i could get more avocado for my tuna entrée.  he made it very apparent and direct that he could not help me with that situation and i would have to flag down my  waitress so she could bill me for the four dollar avocado.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
              "4  we checked in around : pm.  check-in was quick and easy with complimentary valet parking (always appreciated).  the peppermill is huge and reminded us of the caesars palace in las vegas.  they have around eight restaurants on site offering almost any type of food you could want.  the casino area is huge, rivaling almost anything you could find in las vegas.  one thing we noticed is that many of the slot machines were noted as being penny machines, but when you actually started to play them you realized they had minimum bets of anywhere from  cents to $.  talk about false advertising!  we were in the tuscany tower on the th floor.  our room had a nice view of the huge pool area.  our room was large and featured free wifi (likewise always appreciated), a huge bathroom area with large shower (with two shower heads), tv, a large jetted bathtub and a phone next to the commode.  there were dual sinks and lots of counter space.  plenty of towels were supplied.  the roomy main area had a king bed with night stands, closet, tv, mini fridge, dresser with two drawers, a safe, table for computer or writing, complimentary bottles of water, and three nicely upholstered chairs and table.  the thermostat did a good job controlling the temperature and keeping it comfortable.  staff were all courteous and helpful.  a very nice place and we enjoyed our stay.   \n",

              "3       i at least have to give this restaurant two stars due to the decent food. but while on a dinner meeting and after spending $ on entrées and appetizers, i had to flag down the assistant cook, (the guy in bright red baggy pants watching tv), to see if i could get more avocado for my tuna entrée. he made it very apparent and direct that he could not help me with that situation and i would have to flag down my waitress so she could bill me for the four dollar avocado.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
              "4       we checked in around : pm. check-in was quick and easy with complimentary valet parking (always appreciated). the peppermill is huge and reminded us of the caesars palace in las vegas. they have around eight restaurants on site offering almost any type of food you could want. the casino area is huge, rivaling almost anything you could find in las vegas. one thing we noticed is that many of the slot machines were noted as being penny machines, but when you actually started to play them you realized they had minimum bets of anywhere from cents to $. talk about false advertising! we were in the tuscany tower on the th floor. our room had a nice view of the huge pool area. our room was large and featured free wifi (likewise always appreciated), a huge bathroom area with large shower (with two shower heads), tv, a large jetted bathtub and a phone next to the commode. there were dual sinks and lots of counter space. plenty of towels were supplied. the roomy main area had a king bed with night stands, closet, tv, mini fridge, dresser with two drawers, a safe, table for computer or writing, complimentary bottles of water, and three nicely upholstered chairs and table. the thermostat did a good job controlling the temperature and keeping it comfortable. staff were all courteous and helpful. a very nice place and we enjoyed our stay.   \n",

              "570441  located in the 'walking district' in nashville, it's was a bit out of the way for us, but we were on a mission to experience the proclaimed 'greatest burger in nashville'. the menu includes several burgers, wursthen, and chicken sandwich options. the waitress told us that the farm burger is the most popular. i for one have never had a burger with an egg and the thought of it isn't very appealing. i ended up ordering the 'pharmacy burger', which is a less cheesier version of their 'cheese burger' that my husband ordered. they loaded the mustard, but that really wasn't what i didn't like about it. it really wasn't that i disliked the burger, it just wasn't anywhere near one of the best burgers that i've had. the extra toppings at fifty cents each are pretty skimpy too. i was a fan of the wasabi aioli though. i also loved the tater tots though. i highly recommend ordering tater tots over the french fries. the beer cheese dipping sauce was an extra dollar and was borderline disgusting. stick with wasabi aioli. i'm thinking that the toppings and sauces are possibly what the hype about this place is, otherwise, i just don't get it. to describe this place in one word... overhyped.                                                                                                                                                            \n",

              "3  i at least have to give this restaurant two stars due to the decent food. but while on a dinner meeting and after spending $ on entrées and appetizers, i had to flag down the assistant cook, (the guy in bright red baggy pants watching tv), to see if i could get more avocado for my tuna entrée. he made it very apparent and direct that he could not help me with that situation and i would have to flag down my waitress so she could bill me for the four dollar avocado.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
              "4  we checked in around : pm. check-in was quick and easy with complimentary valet parking (always appreciated). the peppermill is huge and reminded us of the caesars palace in las vegas. they have around eight restaurants on site offering almost any type of food you could want. the casino area is huge, rivaling almost anything you could find in las vegas. one thing we noticed is that many of the slot machines were noted as being penny machines, but when you actually started to play them you realized they had minimum bets of anywhere from cents to $. talk about false advertising! we were in the tuscany tower on the th floor. our room had a nice view of the huge pool area. our room was large and featured free wifi (likewise always appreciated), a huge bathroom area with large shower (with two shower heads), tv, a large jetted bathtub and a phone next to the commode. there were dual sinks and lots of counter space. plenty of towels were supplied. the roomy main area had a king bed with night stands, closet, tv, mini fridge, dresser with two drawers, a safe, table for computer or writing, complimentary bottles of water, and three nicely upholstered chairs and table. the thermostat did a good job controlling the temperature and keeping it comfortable. staff were all courteous and helpful. a very nice place and we enjoyed our stay.   \n",

              "3  i at least have to give this restaurant two stars due to the decent food. but while on a dinner meeting and after spending $ on entrées and appetizers, i had to flag down the assistant cook, (the guy in bright red baggy pants watching tv), to see if i could get more avocado for my tuna entrée. he made it very apparent and direct that he could not help me with that situation and i would have to flag down my waitress so she could bill me for the four dollar avocado.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
              "4  we checked in around : pm. check-in was quick and easy with complimentary valet parking (always appreciated). the peppermill is huge and reminded us of the caesars palace in las vegas. they have around eight restaurants on site offering almost any type of food you could want. the casino area is huge, rivaling almost anything you could find in las vegas. one thing we noticed is that many of the slot machines were noted as being penny machines, but when you actually started to play them you realized they had minimum bets of anywhere from cents to $. talk about false advertising! we were in the tuscany tower on the th floor. our room had a nice view of the huge pool area. our room was large and featured free wifi (likewise always appreciated), a huge bathroom area with large shower (with two shower heads), tv, a large jetted bathtub and a phone next to the commode. there were dual sinks and lots of counter space. plenty of towels were supplied. the roomy main area had a king bed with night stands, closet, tv, mini fridge, dresser with two drawers, a safe, table for computer or writing, complimentary bottles of water, and three nicely upholstered chairs and table. the thermostat did a good job controlling the temperature and keeping it comfortable. staff were all courteous and helpful. a very nice place and we enjoyed our stay.   \n",
