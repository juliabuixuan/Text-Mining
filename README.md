# Text-Mining
Topic modeling is an unsupervised machine learning approach, used in natural language processing, to automatically discover the latent topics present in a collection of text documents. The most commonly used algorithm for topic modeling is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). It is used in the develpment of this project, on the Yelp reviews dataset.
